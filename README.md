# Decision-Tree Laptop Buyer Predictor

A classification project using a Decision Tree algorithm to predict whether an individual is likely to purchase a laptop, based on demographic and financial data.

---

##  Project Overview

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, training a Decision Tree model, and evaluating its performance to provide actionable insights into factors influencing laptop purchasing behavior.

---

##  Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset with summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling as needed.
- **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a user will buy a laptop.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Interpretability**: Visualize the tree structure and key feature importances to interpret model decisions.
